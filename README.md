# HackX

### Why use this system?

There are so many different systems that provide the ability to register people for events, but there is no one system that covers all of the things required for running a hackathon. This is where HackX comes in. HackX is the first system that involves hacker registration, mentor registration, judge registration, mentor-ticket queueing, administration views with data analysis, a resume book and judging. We know that's a lot for one system to do. Here's some instructions for setup.
